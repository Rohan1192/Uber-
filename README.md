# Uber Data Analytics Using Mage  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on performing comprehensive data analytics on Uber datasets to uncover actionable insights and optimize processes. By leveraging a combination of modern tools and technologies, we streamline the entire data workflowâ€”from storage and processing to visualization and analysis.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **GCP Storage:** Efficiently store and manage large datasets.  
- **Python:** Handle data preprocessing, analysis, and scripting tasks.  
- **Compute Instances:** Execute resource-intensive computations with scalability.  
- **Mage:** Automate and streamline ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines.  
- **BigQuery:** Perform advanced SQL-based analytics on massive datasets.  
- **Looker Studio:** Create interactive dashboards for effective data visualization.  

## Key Objectives  
1. Efficiently process and manage Uber datasets.  
2. Automate data workflows with Mage pipelines.  
3. Perform advanced analytics using BigQuery to uncover trends and insights.  
4. Visualize findings through dynamic dashboards in Looker Studio.  

## Features  
- **ETL Pipelines:** Implemented with Mage to streamline data integration and transformation.  
- **Data Analytics:** In-depth analysis using Python and BigQuery for uncovering trends and optimizing decision-making.  
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Visualize key insights with Looker Studio for a user-friendly representation of data.  

## Workflow  
1. **Data Storage:** Uber data is securely stored and managed using GCP Storage.  
2. **Data Transformation:** Mage pipelines extract, transform, and load data for analysis.  
3. **Analytics:** BigQuery processes transformed data, providing actionable insights.  
4. **Visualization:** Insights are presented through interactive dashboards in Looker Studio.
